R code and output for planned analyses for Stage 1 Registered Report:  

**Title**: Red state, blue state: Do dichotomized political maps increase perceived polarization?  
**Authors**: RÃ©my A. Furrer (1), Gary Lupyan (2), Karen Schloss (2), Paula M. Niedenthal (2), & Adrienne Wood (1)  
**Affiliations**: 1. Department of Psychology, University of Virginia; 2. Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin  

**Note on files**: 
* The *analysis_plan_with_simulated_data.Rmd* file synthesizes data and runs the planned analyses on the data. This file is useful if you want to replicate our planned analyses. 
* The *analysis_plan_with_simulated_data.html* file is a knitted markdown file that shows the code plus the output with graphs. This file is useful if you just want to know what we did (and want to see it in a prettier format).
